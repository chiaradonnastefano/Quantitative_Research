# JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Research Virtual Experience  

This repository contains two mini-projects completed as part of the **JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Research (QR) Virtual Experience** hosted on Forage. These projects provide insights into financial modeling and risk analysis through practical applications.  

## Projects Overview  

### 1. **Natural Gas Pricing Model**  
**Objective:** Develop a pricing model for natural gas storage contracts using statistical and machine learning techniques to improve pricing accuracy.  

**Key Steps:**  
- **Data Analysis & Seasonality Identification:** Used time series analysis (e.g., STL decomposition) to extract trends and seasonal effects in natural gas prices.  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and reformatted date-time data.  
- **Model Development:** Explored polynomial regression and seasonal models, comparing performance using error metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
- **Contract Pricing:** Applied the model to estimate future prices for informed decision-making in natural gas storage contracts.

### 2. **Credit Risk Analysis: Loan Default Prediction**  
**Objective:** Predict the probability of loan default using a **Random Forest** model, enabling financial institutions to assess risk effectively.  

**Key Steps:**  
- **Feature Engineering:** Derived additional financial indicators, such as the **Debt-to-Income Ratio** and **Credit Utilization Ratio**, to improve predictive power.  
- **Model Training & Optimization:** Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**, fine-tuned hyperparameters, and evaluated performance using AUC-ROC and a confusion matrix.  
- **Expected Loss Calculation:** Estimated potential financial losses based on probability of default (PD), loan amount, and recovery rates.

#### **FICO Score Quantization (Sub-Task)**  
- Implemented quantization techniques (MSE-based and log-likelihood methods) to categorize FICO scores into risk buckets for better model generalization.  
- Evaluated quantization impact using **AUC-ROC** to maintain predictive accuracy across different distributions.  

## Conclusion  

These projects apply statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to quantitative finance, demonstrating practical approaches to pricing, forecasting, and risk assessment. The work provides valuable insights into financial modeling methodologies used in industry.
